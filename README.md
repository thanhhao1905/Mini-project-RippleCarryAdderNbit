# mini-project-RippleCarryAdderNbit
Verilog simulation of a parameterized N-bit Ripple Carry Adder.

Ripple Carry Adder N-bit
This project implements a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) capable of adding N-bit binary numbers. The RCA is one of the most fundamental architectures for performing binary addition in digital systems, and this project provides a practical example of its operation.

Key Features:

Scalable: The design allows for easy configuration to add numbers of varying bit lengths (N bits).

Modular Design: The project structure is built upon basic modules like Half Adders and Full Adders, clearly demonstrating how smaller logic blocks combine to form a larger system.

Simulation and Testing: Includes testbench files to verify the correctness of the design, ensuring the adder functions accurately for various input cases.

Educational Application: This serves as an excellent learning resource for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture, digital circuit design, and Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog/VHDL.

Purpose:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear and fully functional illustrative example of a Ripple Carry Adder. It is highly beneficial for students, electronics engineers, or anyone interested in the field of chip design and embedded systems.

Technologies Used:

EDA tool - Icarus Verilog 12.0 tool, Visual Code Studio.
